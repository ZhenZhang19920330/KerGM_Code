% This function is used to compute the gradient
% Input:
%      X:                    Current Variable X
%      EdgeFeat1, EdgeFeat2: The edge feature tensor of graph1 and graph2
%      AA, BB:               Two n*n matrices: AA=EdgeFeat1*EdgeFeat1, 
%                            BB=EdgeFeat2*EdgeFeat2
% Output:
%      grad:  The gradient, i.e, 
%             grad=(1-2alpha)*EdgeFeat1*EdgeFeat1*X+...
%                  +(1-2alpha)*X*EdgeFeat2*EdgeFeat2+...
